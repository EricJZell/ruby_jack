# Ruby Jack

Ruby Jack is a simple black jack application written in ruby with a focus
on abstracting key game features into Objects. The classes created are Card, Deck,
Hand, and BlackJack.
It is now a Sinatra app.
To try the app, clone the repository to your machine, then:

* In your terminal: ```$ruby server.rb```
* Go to http://localhost:4567/home

The app requires ruby with the sinatra gem. The RSpec gem will also be required
if you wish to run the test suite.
